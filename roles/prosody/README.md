This task prepares a prosody server. Optionally, it can install converse.js as client using the `mod_conversejs` module for prosody.

Note that, unless you use the `prosody_insecure_test_only` option (that skips TLS completely), you need to provide your own certificates. See here for details: https://prosody.im/doc/certificates
